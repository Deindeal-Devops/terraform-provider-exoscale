# Examples

## Cloud Init

setting up basic features on your instances at first boot. This demo creates
a set of three Docker Swarm masters and the security groups between them.

## SSH Keys

Create a dynamic SSH keys and use it to connect to the Compute resource.

## Import Compute

If creating resources is common task, importing existing becomes very
convenient when one wants to start managing its infrastructure on Exoscale
using TerraForm. This demo shows how to import a compute instance and its
security groups.

## IPv6

A machine experimenting with the IPv6 support.

## (Multi-)Private Network
