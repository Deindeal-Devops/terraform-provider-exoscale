# Examples

## Cloud Init

Being used internally at Exoscale, Cloud-Init is the tool provided to you for
setting up basic features on your instances at first boot. This demo creates
a set of three Docker Swarm masters and the security groups between them.

## Import Compute

If creating resources is common task, importing existing becomes very
convenient when one wants to start managing its infrastructure on Exoscale
using TerraForm. This demo shows how to import a compute instance and its
security groups.

## (Multi-)Private Network

An example showing how the [Private networks](https://www.exoscale.ch/syslog/2018/01/17/introducing-multiple-private-networks/)
API support can be used to create a private network between compute instances.
